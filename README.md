# 15-Puzzle

Given an initial space separated representation (i.e. 2 3 5 1 9 8 10 12 14 4 6 7 11 13 0 15) of a 15 puzzle (4x4 matrix), we have to find out if by swapping the tiles in up, down, left or right direction, we can get to a goal state (i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 0) where 0 represents empty tile.

We have used two heurisitics.
- Displacement
- Manhattan distance
